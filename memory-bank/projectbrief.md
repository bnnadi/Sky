# Project Brief: Sky - Modern Student Portal Mobile App

## Project Overview
A modern React Native mobile application demonstrating contemporary UX patterns for student information systems. This is a **demo/portfolio project** that showcases modern mobile app design patterns and does not handle real student data.

## Core Purpose
- Demonstrate modern mobile UI/UX design patterns for education technology
- Showcase student portal interfaces (Dashboard, Grades, Attendance)
- Showcase React Native development capabilities
- Provide a portfolio piece demonstrating mobile app architecture for EdTech

## Key Requirements
1. **Three Main Screens:**
   - Dashboard: Student profile, GPA, attendance summary, quick stats, recent activity
   - Grades: Subject list with color-coded grades, sorting, filtering
   - Attendance: Interactive charts, monthly trends, absence tracking

2. **Technical Requirements:**
   - React Native with Expo framework
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Modern UI with TailwindCSS (NativeWind)
   - State management with Zustand
   - Navigation with React Navigation (Bottom Tabs + Stack)

3. **Data Requirements:**
   - **Mock data only** - no real API connections
   - Local JSON files for all data
   - Realistic but fake student information

4. **Design Requirements:**
   - Clean, modern interface
   - Consistent color scheme (blue primary, green success, etc.)
   - Smooth animations and interactions
   - Responsive layouts

## Constraints
- **No real data handling** - purely demonstration
- **No backend integration** - all data is local
- **Demo purpose only** - not for production use
- Must maintain privacy-first approach (no real student data)

## Success Criteria
- All three main screens functional and visually appealing
- Smooth navigation between screens
- Interactive charts and data visualizations
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- Modern UI/UX patterns demonstrated
