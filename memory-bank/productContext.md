# Product Context: Skyward UX Demo App

## Why This Project Exists
This app serves as a **UI/UX demonstration and portfolio piece** that recreates key screens from Skyward, a popular student information system. It showcases modern mobile app design patterns and React Native development capabilities.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Portfolio Demonstration**: Provides a concrete example of mobile app development skills
2. **UI/UX Showcase**: Demonstrates modern design patterns and user experience principles
3. **Technical Demonstration**: Shows proficiency with React Native, TypeScript, and modern tooling
4. **Design Reference**: Serves as a reference for redesigning student information system interfaces

## How It Should Work

### User Flow
1. **App Launch** → User lands on Dashboard screen
2. **Navigation** → User can switch between Dashboard, Grades, and Attendance via bottom tabs
3. **Dashboard** → View student profile, GPA, attendance, quick stats, and recent activity
4. **Grades** → Browse subjects, view grades with color coding, search/filter/sort
5. **Attendance** → View attendance charts, monthly trends, and recent absences

### Key Interactions
- **Pull-to-refresh** on Dashboard to reload data
- **Search and filter** on Grades screen
- **Interactive charts** on Attendance screen
- **Smooth tab navigation** with visual feedback

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear bottom tab navigation with icons and labels
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information (GPA, attendance) prominently displayed
3. **Color Coding**: Grades use color to quickly communicate performance (green=A, yellow=B, red=C/D/F)
4. **Data Visualization**: Charts make attendance trends easy to understand
5. **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators when data is being fetched
6. **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Developers/designers reviewing portfolio work
- **Secondary**: Anyone interested in modern mobile app UI/UX patterns
- **Note**: Not intended for actual student use (mock data only)

## Design Philosophy
- **Clean and Modern**: Minimal clutter, clear typography, ample whitespace
- **Color-Coded Information**: Use color strategically to convey meaning
- **Card-Based Layout**: Information grouped in cards for easy scanning
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified design system across all screens
- **Accessible**: High contrast, readable text sizes, clear touch targets
